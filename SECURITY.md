- ✅ Stores configuration in JSON files on your computer
- ✅ Only launches applications you explicitly add
- ✅ Has no network access or telemetry
- ✅ Doesn't collect or transmit any data

**Best practices:**

- Only add applications you trust
- Download releases from official GitHub releases page

- Build from source if you prefer
