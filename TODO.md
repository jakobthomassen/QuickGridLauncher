# TODO

Future improvements and feature ideas.

## 🔥 High Priority

### Visual Polish

- [ ] **Launch feedback animation** - Brief "pop" or glow on selected tile before overlay closes

### Usability

- [ ] **First-run experience** - Auto-open settings on first launch if no apps configured
- [ ] **App launch counter** - Track usage and optionally auto-sort by frequency

---

## 🎯 Medium Priority

### Enhanced Navigation

- [ ] **Mouse support** - Hover to select, click to launch, scroll wheel navigation
- [ ] **Number key shortcuts** - Press 1-9 to launch first 9 apps directly
- [ ] **App tabs** - Organize apps into quick swappable tabs (Q, E)

### Customization

- [ ] **Custom app labels** - Override display name (e.g., "Chrome" instead of "chrome.exe")
- [ ] **Custom app icons** - Browse for .ico/.png files instead of extracting from .exe
- [ ] **Tile size options** - Small (50px), Medium (70px, current), Large (90px)
- [ ] **Animation speed control** - Slider for entrance/exit animation duration

### Power User Features

- [ ] **Portable mode** - Store config.json in app directory instead of AppData
- [ ] **Import/Export config** - Backup and restore settings as JSON file

### Nice to Have

- [ ] **URL shortcuts** - Add web links as launchable items
